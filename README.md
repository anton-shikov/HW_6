# HW_6 GEO_seacrh interface. 
A sall prorgam for executing GSEA algorithm on desirable GEO exmeriment and genes set

## Getting Started

This tool allows you to calculate p.value with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with gene list in desirable experiments

### Prerequisites

You need to install python3 with numpy, pandas, GEOparse, scipy and PyQt5 to run this tool.

### Installing

To install this tool clone this repository to your PC.

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/anton-shikov/HW_6
```

## Running and using tool

Using this tool is not complicted. Just run GUI.py file and put GEO_id in the first text label and genes list separated by space and after that click "Get p_value" button to get Kolmogorov-Smirnov test result:
